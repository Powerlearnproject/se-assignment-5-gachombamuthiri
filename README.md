9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   Open Your Project in VS Code:

Open VS Code and navigate to File -> Open Folder to open your project folder.
Configure Launch Settings:

Create or modify a launch configuration file (launch.json) in your project.
This file specifies how VS Code should start debugging your program.
VS Code can auto-generate this file for many programming languages.
Set Breakpoints:

Navigate to the file where you want to set breakpoints.
Click in the gutter next to the line number to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear indicating the breakpoint.
Start Debugging:

Press F5 or go to the Debug view (View -> Debug) and click the green play button next to the configuration you want to run.
This will launch your program in debug mode.
Debugging Controls:

Once debugging starts, you can use the following controls in the debug toolbar:
Step Over (F10): Executes the current line of code and stops at the next line.
Step Into (F11): If the current line calls a function, steps into that function.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Steps out of the current function and back to the calling function.
Continue (F5): Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint is encountered or the program ends.
Inspect Variables and Call Stack:

While debugging, you can hover over variables to see their current values.
Use the Variables and Watch panes in the Debug view to inspect variables more closely.
The Call Stack pane shows the current call stack, allowing you to navigate through function calls.
Debug Console:

The Debug Console allows you to execute commands or view output directly from your program while debugging.
Stop Debugging:

To stop debugging, press the red square stop button in the debug toolbar or simply close the debug session.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Multi-language Support: VS Code supports debugging for a wide range of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, etc.

Integrated Terminal: You can open a terminal within VS Code, which is useful for debugging scripts that require input or for running commands alongside debugging.

Debugging Configuration: VS Code provides a flexible way to configure debugging environments through launch.json files, supporting different types of debuggers (e.g., Node.js, Python Debugger, C++ Debugger).

Breakpoints: You can set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to a line number, allowing you to pause execution at specific points to inspect variables and program state.

Variable Watch: Easily monitor the values of variables by adding them to the Watch pane. Values update in real-time as you step through your code.

Call Stack: View the function call hierarchy (call stack) during debugging, which helps in understanding the flow of execution and diagnosing issues.

Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met, enhancing flexibility in debugging.

Debugging Hotkeys: Handy shortcuts (e.g., F5 for continue, F10 for step over) make debugging more efficient and intuitive.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub
    Initialize a Git Repository
If you have an existing project that is not yet under version control, or if you're starting a new project, you'll need to initialize a Git repository.

Steps:

Open VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Open your project: Open the folder or project you want to track with Git.

Open the Source Control view: Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G).

Initialize Git: In the Source Control view, click on the Initialize Repository button. Alternatively, you can open a terminal within VS Code (Ctrl + ) and run git init to initialize Git manually.

2. Make Commits
Once your repository is initialized, you can start making commits to save changes and track the history of your project.

Steps:

Stage changes: In the Source Control view, you'll see all the changed files. Click the + button next to each file you want to stage for the commit, or use Stage All Changes to stage all changes at once.

Commit changes: After staging your changes, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.

Type your commit message.
Press Ctrl + Enter (or click the checkmark ✓) to commit the changes.
View commit history: You can view your commit history by clicking on the clock icon in the Source Control view.

3. Push Changes to GitHub
If you want to push your repository to GitHub (or any other remote Git repository), follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have a GitHub account and a repository created on GitHub.
Steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub (if not already created):

Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Note down the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).
Add remote repository URL:

In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and type Git: Add Remote.
Paste the repository URL you copied from GitHub and press Enter.
Push changes:

After making commits, click on the ellipsis (...) in the Source Control view and select Push.
Choose the branch you want to push (usually main or master).
VS Code will prompt you for your GitHub credentials if needed.
Verify on GitHub:

Go to your repository on GitHub and refresh the page to see your changes.
Additional Tips:
Pulling changes: Before pushing changes, it's good practice to pull any changes from the remote repository to ensure you have the latest updates (Git: Pull from the Command Palette).
Branching and merging: VS Code supports branching and merging through the Source Control view, allowing you to manage complex workflows.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
